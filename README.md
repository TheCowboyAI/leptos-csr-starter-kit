# Leptos CSR with TailwindCSS Starter Template
Unlock rapid development with Leptos, paired seamlessly with TailwindCSS. This template is crafted to save you the hassle of piecing everything together. Developers can focus on what truly matters: building outstanding web applications.


## Quick Start ðŸš€
Inspired by `create-react-app`, globally install the [`create-leptos-csr-tw`](https://crates.io/crates/create-leptos-csr-tw) crate.
```bash
cargo add create-leptos-csr-tw
```

Once installed, you can generate a new Leptos project with TailwindCSS by simply running:
```bash

```

## Features

### 1. **TailwindCSS Ready**
The project is set up with TailwindCSS based on the recommended configurations from [GreatGreg's guide](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/discussions/125).

### 2. **Vercel Deployment**
To deploy seamlessly on Vercel, the provided `vercel.json` file is set up to handle routing correctly. With this configuration, any unmatched route will serve the `index.html` file, letting the client-side logic handle the routing. This is ideal for single-page applications.

### 3. **Public Assets Management**
Your static assets like images are in good hands. Place them in the `/public` folder and they'll be automatically copied to the `/dist` during compilation. No missed assets after building!

### 4. **Leptos-Use**
Benefit from pre-included [Leptos-Use](https://github.com/Synphonyte/leptos-use/tree/main), your go-to collection of essential Leptos utilities. 


## Conclusion
Whether you're looking to quickly prototype or build a production-ready application, this starter template offers a solid foundation for your Leptos-based projects. Adjust and extend as per your requirements!
